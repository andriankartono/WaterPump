# WaterPump #

This Project is about doing predictive maintenance on Water Pumps in Africa. The Dataset comes from the drivendata Website (https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/).
In this repository, there are 3 important codes that you can run: dataset_explanation.ipynb, Final_Project.ipynb and dashboard.py

The dependencies for this project are dash, plotly, sklearn, numpy, and pandas. (Also Jupyter Notebook if you want to run the Notebook)<br>
All contents of this repositories may be updated at any time.

## dataset_explanation.ipynb ##
This Jupyter Notebook contains a short explanation of the dataset in a notebook. Currently it shows a short data understanding process that
is usually done in data related projects. 

## Final_project.ipynb ##
This Jupyter NB contains the script used to create the whole machine learning model and evaluations on the machine learning model.

## Dashboard.py ##
This Python script runs the whole load dataset and also the commands run on Final_project.ipynb with additional dashboard visualization.
Run the script in a command prompt and open the corresponding link to access the dashboard locally (usually 127.0.0.1:8050). 
Currently the dashboard is only available in dark mode but may be updated in the future to support light mode as well.
